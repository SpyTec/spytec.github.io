description: From previous blog, Hello world!

## **Note:** This was built on now deprecated [SaberJS](https://github.com/saberland) and has since been deprecated in favor of a more simplistic blog. You can find the [source contents of the old website on GitHub](https://github.com/SpyTec/spytec-saber-website)

It's been maybe 5 years since I last created a blog/website for myself. Figured I'd re-create one! Right now I'm an associate software engineer at Red Hat. My plan for this blog is to focus on topics I enjoy or problems I've solved that others could learn from.

Apart from being a developer, I'm a gamer and a community moderator. I currently moderate communities of

- [r/EliteDangerous](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous)
- [r/PlanetZoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetZoo) (As well as the [r/PlanetZoo Discord](https://discord.gg/vAkVsak))
- [r/redhat](https://www.reddit.com/r/redhat)
- [r/fedora](https://www.reddit.com/r/fedora)

With my primary focus on r/EliteDangerous and r/PlanetZoo.

# What is it build on?

My previous website was made using CodeIgniter, with my own styling, my own database queries, and a lot of issues. I was able to query websites by their query, display the most popular posts and tags, and I had my own cards for my projects.

_Rest of the blog deleted as it was specific to SaberJS_
